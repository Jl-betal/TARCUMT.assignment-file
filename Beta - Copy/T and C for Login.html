                    <p>1) Welcome to the UMT platform (the "Site"). Please read the following Terms of Service carefully
                        before using this Site or opening a UMT account ("Account") so that you are aware of your legal
                        rights and obligations with respect to UMT.Sdn. Bhd. (Company Registration No. 201501009497
                        (1134832-W)) and its affiliates and subsidiaries (individually and collectively, "UMT", "we",
                        "us" or "our"). The "Services" we provide or make available include (a) the Site, (b) the
                        services provided by the Site and by UMT client software made available through the Site, and
                        (c) all information, linked pages, features, data, text, images, photographs, graphics, music,
                        sounds, video (including live streams), messages, tags, content, programming, software,
                        application services (including, without limitation, any mobile application services) or other
                        materials made available through the Site or its related services ("Content"). Any new features
                        added to or augmenting the Services are also subject to these Terms of Service. These Terms of
                        Service govern your use of Services provided by UMT.
                    </p>

                    <P>2) The Services include an online platform service that provides a place and opportunity for the
                        sale of goods between the buyer (“Buyer”) and the seller (“Seller”) (collectively “you”, “Users”
                        or “Parties”). The actual contract for sale is directly between Buyer and Seller and UMT is not
                        a party to that or any other contract between Buyer and Seller and accepts no obligations in
                        connection with any such contract. Parties to such transaction will be entirely responsible for
                        the sales contract between them, the listing of goods, warranty of purchase and the like. UMT is
                        not involved in the transaction between Users. UMT may or may not pre-screen Users or the
                        Content or information provided by Users. UMT reserves the right to remove any Content or
                        information posted by you on the Site in accordance to Section 6.4 herein. UMT cannot ensure
                        that Users will actually complete a transaction.</P>


                    <p>3) Before becoming a User of the Site, you must read and accept all of the terms and conditions
                        in, and linked to, these Terms of Service and you must consent to the processing of your

                    <p>4) UMT reserves the right to change, modify, suspend or discontinue all or any part of this Site
                        or the Services at any time or upon notice as required by local laws. UMT may release certain
                        Services or their features in a beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way
                        the final version may work, and we shall not be held liable in such instances. UMT may also
